# Configuration file for Yaws HTTP daemon

# This config defines SSL-enabled virtual server localhost.
# It is enabled by default. If you want to disable it, remove
# symlink from /etc/yaws/conf.d/.

# Instead you may edit this file and after that reload
# yaws configureation using invoke-rc.d yaws reload

# (If you want to use privileged port, run yaws as root,
# setting YAWS_USER in /etc/default/yaws, or use port
# redirection, e.g. via iptables.)
